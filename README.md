## üöÄ Overview

> Cognos is a production-level AI agent built on the powerful **"ReAct" (Reason + Act)** framework. Unlike traditional models that provide an immediate answer, Cognos externalizes its reasoning process. It analyzes complex problems, creates a multi-step plan, executes actions using a suite of tools (like web search and a calculator), and observes the results to adjust its plan until the final answer is found.

This project is an ideal showcase for a startup interview, as it demonstrates the ability to build sophisticated, autonomous AI systems that can solve real-world problems.

## ‚ú® Core Features & Skills Demonstrated

| Feature                  | Description                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **üß† ReAct Framework**     | Masterful implementation of the **Thought -> Action -> Observation** loop, the cornerstone of modern agentic AI.                        |
| **üõ†Ô∏è Dynamic Tool Use**      | The agent intelligently selects from a suite of tools (web search, calculator) based on its reasoning to solve a given sub-task.      |
| **üîó Complex Decomposition** | Cognos can break down a complex, multi-hop question into a series of simpler, actionable steps.                                        |
| **üëÅÔ∏è Transparent Reasoning** | `verbose=True` output makes the agent's "thought process" visible, providing a clear audit trail of its plan.                           |
| **‚úÖ Production-Ready**    | Organized with a modular architecture, dependency management (`requirements.txt`), and secure key management (`.env`).                   |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works: The ReAct Loop

Cognos operates on a continuous cycle until it arrives at a final answer. This iterative process allows it to build context and refine its approach at each step.

</p>

1.  **Thought:** Based on the user's query, the LLM thinks about what it needs to do next. It considers its goal and the tools it has available.
2.  **Action:** The agent chooses a tool and formulates an input for it.
3.  **Observation:** The `AgentExecutor` runs the tool and returns the result.
4.  **Repeat:** The observation is fed back to the LLM. It then begins the next `Thought` step, incorporating its new knowledge, and continues the cycle until it has enough information to give a final answer.

## ü§ñ Sample Walkthrough

This example shows the agent's "chain of thought" as it tackles a problem that requires both searching for information and performing calculations.

**User Query:**
`What was the stock price of NVIDIA (NVDA) at the close of its IPO date, and how many times greater is its current stock price compared to that initial price?`

**Agent Execution Log:**
```shell
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

ü§î Thought: I need to find two pieces of information: NVIDIA's IPO closing price and its current stock price. After I have both values, I need to perform a division to find out how many times greater the current price is. I will start by finding the IPO price.
‚ö° Action: Search
Action Input: "NVIDIA (NVDA) IPO date and price"

üëÄ Observation: NVIDIA (NVDA) went public on January 22, 1999, at a price of $12 per share. Due to multiple stock splits over the years, the split-adjusted IPO price is approximately $0.40.

ü§î Thought: I have found the split-adjusted IPO price, which is $0.40. This is the correct value to use for a fair comparison. Now, I need to find the current stock price of NVIDIA.
‚ö° Action: Search
Action Input: "current stock price of NVIDIA (NVDA)"

üëÄ Observation: As of July 2025, the stock price for NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is approximately $131.88.

ü§î Thought: I have both the split-adjusted IPO price ($0.40) and the current price ($131.88). Now I must use the Calculator to find out how many times greater the current price is than the IPO price.
‚ö° Action: Calculator
Action Input: 131.88 / 0.40

üëÄ Observation: Answer: 329.7

ü§î Thought: I have successfully found the IPO price, the current price, and performed the calculation to compare them. I now have the final answer.
‚úÖ Final Answer: NVIDIA's split-adjusted IPO price was approximately $0.40 per share. Its current price is about $131.88, which is approximately 329.7 times greater than the initial price.

> Finished chain.
